CURRENT PROJECT SCOPE:
A Web App that allows Users to post photos and updates about their city's
rich architectural landscape. Photos can include progress on a new skyscraper,
the redevelopment of a historic building, an awesome sunset from the roofdeck,
or even just a really cool door-knocker.

FUTURE PROJECT SCOPE:
To build a mobile app for both iOS and Android devices, allowing photos and their
accompanying notes to be uploaded directly from the device Camera or from the app.
